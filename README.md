# Simon Game

The **Simon Game** is an interactive memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. With each successful
repetition, the sequence gets longer and more challenging. The game tests your memory and reflexes as you strive to keep up with Simonâ€™s
ever-increasing patterns.
